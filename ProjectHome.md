Gabbro-balsamiq-parser is a code generator, it analyzes balsamiq mockup files, reconstructs the hierachy of widgets , uses the freemarker templating engine to generate the HTML code (or other code) and Jericho libraries to internationalize the html code. Simple templates are provided in example to generate bootstrap HTML5 code.

This program offers many opportunities, such as the generation of DTO classes from the binding of informations entered into the model, the ability to generate JavaScript code or java and so on ...

This application is for use by developers who want to automate and industrialize the generation of web pages from the Balsamiq mockup tool.
The evolution and creation of templates requires a basic knowledge of the Freemarker solution. Code generation with Gabbro is adapted to HTML5 Bootstrap framework, because the positions of each widget are recalculated in 12 th against the father container.

The mechanics used in templating can manage 3 types of templates: HTML, Javascript, and (or java scala); it can automate code generation of Human Machine Interface and this until the controller layer.
We will provide in samples an example of template for controller code generation.

We use this solution on business projects
