Balsamiq is a wireframe tool to easily create screen mockups. Gabbro is designed to allow rapid generation of source code from the definition of the model. Code generation is from freemarker templates.
The mockup of the screen must follow certain rules, in particular the concept of container and alignment of different widgets. The mockup guide details the different rules.
Gabbro reconstructs a hierarchy of different mockups and recalculates the position of each in relation to the father widget container. The position of each widget is also calculated twelfth with an offset relative to the beginning of the line. (same bootstrap)
